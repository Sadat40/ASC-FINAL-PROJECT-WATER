    <h2 id ="h2c">Addressing the issue of dirty water requires a multi-faceted approach that encompasses various strategies to ensure safe and clean water sources. One crucial step involves establishing and improving water treatment facilities and infrastructure. By investing in these facilities, we can effectively remove contaminants from water sources, rendering the water safe for consumption. Simultaneously, upgrading water distribution systems is essential to prevent leaks and minimize the risk of contamination during transportation.</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Improved sanitation: One of the best ways to prevent waterborne diseases is to improve sanitation. This means building toilets and latrines and providing access to clean water for washing hands. When people have access to toilets and latrines, they are less likely to defecate in the open, which can contaminate water supplies. Clean water for washing hands helps to remove germs from the hands, which can help to prevent the spread of disease.</li>
        <li>Water treatment: Dirty water can be treated to make it safe to drink and use. This can be done through various methods, such as boiling, filtering, and chlorination. Boiling water kills harmful bacteria and viruses. Filtering water removes dirt, sediment, and other particles. Chlorination disinfects water by killing harmful bacteria and viruses.</li>
        <li>Desalination: Desalination is the process of removing salt from seawater. This can be used to produce clean water in areas that do not have access to fresh water. Desalination plants use energy to remove salt from seawater, so they can be expensive to operate. However, they can be a valuable source of water in areas that are not near freshwater sources.</li>
        <li>Rainwater harvesting: Rainwater harvesting is the collection and storage of rainwater for later use. This can be a valuable source of water in areas that do not have reliable access to fresh water. Rainwater is collected from roofs or other surfaces and stored in tanks or cisterns. It can then be used for drinking, cooking, washing, and watering plants.</li>
        <li>Water conservation: Water conservation is the practice of using less water. This can be done by fixing leaks, taking shorter showers, and watering lawns less often. Water conservation is important because it helps to reduce the demand for water, which can help to protect freshwater resources.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2 id ="h2c">In addition to these solutions, there are a number of other technologies and approaches that are being developed or implemented to address the problem of dirty water. These include:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Solar water disinfection (SODIS): SODIS is a method of disinfecting water using sunlight. This method is simple and inexpensive, and it can be used in areas that do not have access to electricity. SODIS works by exposing water to sunlight in clear plastic bottles. The sunlight kills harmful bacteria and viruses in the water.</li>
        <li>Water ATMs: Water ATMs are machines that dispense clean water for a fee. This is a convenient way for people to access clean water, especially in areas where there is no reliable water supply. Water ATMs are often used in developing countries.</li>
        <li>Water filters: Water filters can remove harmful substances from water, making it safe to drink and use. There are a variety of water filters available, including both portable and home-based filters. Water filters can be a great way to improve the quality of water in areas where the water supply is not safe to drink.</li>

    <p id ="causesi">Urban centers are one of the main causes of this problem. Faulty septic systems, leaking sewer lines, pet waste and many others. Industrial waste from factories or processing plants also leak chemicals like asbestos or sulfur. When they dump their wastewater into lakes or rivers. These chemicals can also have a huge effect on the water or life they are dumped into. Ramping up nitrates, phosphates, and sulfites which can diminish oxygen levels and kill wildlife. Mining also can lead to minerals or toxic waste leaching into groundwater being washed away in the rain. Runoff mines also have the ability to change the pH of the surrounding water. Acidic water can easily corrode a home's plumbing. Agriculture is the leading cause of compromised water quality. The chemicals farmers use for crops get washed off into water from rain or flooding flow into a water supply. Improper irrigation practices can also lead to contaminated water.</p>
    <h2 id ="h2c">Distributions centers are easily susceptible to germs and chemicals even after the water has been cleaned. Even from a source like a lake, river or pond water can easily get contaminated. </h2>
    <h3 id="h2c">Here are some things that can contaminate your water:</h3>
    <nav id ="causesnav">
    <ul>
        <li>Fertilizers, pesticides, or other chemicals that have been applied to land near the water</li>
        <li>Concentrated feeding operations (large industrial animal farms)</li>
        <li>Manufacturing operations</li>
        <li>Sewer overflows</li>
        <li>Storm water</li>
        <li>Wildlife</li>
        <li>Rocks and soil that naturally have chemicals and minerals such as arsenic, radon, and uranium</li>
        <li>Cracks in water pipes or other problems in the distribution system</li>
    </ul>
